# NLP-With-Python
Natural Language Processing using Python (January 2025) - Lab Activities

Day 1: 
  1. Use Stop Words
  2. POS tagging
  3. Generate Antonyms
  4. Generate Synonyms

Day 2:
  1. Calculating frequency of top N words
  2. Using NLTK and RE module to tokenize text, remove stop words, special characters
  3. Using wordcloud library to generate word cloud from cleaned text

Day 3: Apply CountVectorization to the input data & answer the following: 
  1. Count Vectorizer Matrix
  2. Vocabulary (unique words in corpus)
  3. Calculating frequency of top N words (top 1 word = most frequent term)
  4. Finding out words that appear in all/maximum sentences/documents
  5. <Doubts>:
     1. What would happen if we set stop_words='english' in the CountVectorizer?
     2. Should we manually explain the tone of 'happy' or should we write a code (Like for pick out term that occurs in all documents)

Day 4: Multinomial Naive Bayes model on 'Movie Review' dataset: 
  1. Pre processing steps - Using NLTK and RE module to:
     1. Tokenize text
     2. Remove stop words
     3. Remove special characters
  2. Word Cloud for the data
  4. MultiNB Model
